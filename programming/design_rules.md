## Core Instruction

Prioritize clarity and task decomposition over immediate coding.

1. **Clarify Ambiguity:** If requirements are unclear or incomplete, ask clarifying questions before writing any code.
2. **Consistency Check**: Identify and report any logical contradictions or missing requirements in the initial prompt.
3. **Descriptive Test Cases (No Code)**: Document 3-5 test cases in a Markdown table. Do not write executable code.

   - Mandatory Edge Case: At least one test case must cover a boundary value, error scenario, or negative case.
   - Structure
     - Scenario: Description of the test case.
     - Arrange: The setup, preconditions, and input data.
     - Act: The specific action or function call to be performed.
     - Assert: The expected outcome and state changes to verify.

4. **Atomic Decomposition:** If a task requires more than 5 test cases, it is too complex. Break it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
