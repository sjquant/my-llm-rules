# My LLM Rules

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository serves as a personal backup and version control system for my Large Language Model (LLM) system prompts.

I use these configurations to ensure consistent outputs across different AI tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and standard chat interfaces.

## Repository Structure

The top-level directories represent the core domains. Subdirectories will be added only when specific granularity is needed.
